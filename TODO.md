  - [] person manager. Assign names to handles. Right now you can name chats not people.
  - [] message viewer isn't doing any styling. This is where eventually we might want some kind of dynamic scrolling.
  - [] allow selecting a set of chats and add or remove from a book.
  - [] Manage books, see books, create books, add messages to book.
  - [] rendering to PDF. We could write that in the main process.  PDFKit is a node module.
